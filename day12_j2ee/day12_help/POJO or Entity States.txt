In Hibernate  APIs, the persistence context is defined as the org.hibernate.Session. In JPA, the persistence context is defined by javax.persistence.EntityManager. Its methods deal with moving entities between these states.


Entity states


new, or transient - the entity has just been instantiated and is not associated with a persistence context. It has no persistent representation in the database and no identifier value has been assigned.

managed, or persistent - the entity has an associated identifier and is associated with a persistence context.

detached - the entity has an associated identifier, but is no longer associated with a persistence context (usually because the persistence context was closed or the instance was evicted from the context)

removed - the entity has an associated identifier and is associated with a persistence context, however it is scheduled for removal from the database.
